# ‚ù§Ô∏è Leveraging the TOTEM algorithm for prediction of a moving base of a ship on oceanic waves. 
  - This is used as an ablation study to the Koopman based model to compare which methods better capture quasi-periodic motion for multi-step prediction. 

# TOTEM: TOkenized Time series EMbeddings for General Time Series Analysis
TOTEM explores time series unification through discrete tokens (not patches!!). Its simple VQVAE backbone learns a self-supervised, discrete, codebook in either a generalist (multiple domains) or specialist (1 domain) manner.
TOTEM's codebook can then be tested on in domain or zero shot data with many üî• time series tasks.

For a high level overview see the [video recap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqrCpdb6MJk).
